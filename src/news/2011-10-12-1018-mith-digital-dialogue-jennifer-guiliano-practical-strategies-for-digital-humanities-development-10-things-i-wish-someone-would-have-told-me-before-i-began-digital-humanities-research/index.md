"Practical Strategies for Digital Humanities Development: 10 Things I Wish Someone Would Have Told Me Before I Began Digital Humanities Research" by JENNIFER GUILIANO

![Jennifer Guiliano](/images/2012-11-photo11-200x200.jpg)

This talk offers lessons learned from managing individual, multi-institutional, and international research agendas in the digital humanities. From topics as varied as “Collaboration: Why we love it and how it can harm a project” to “Your great idea: why it isn’t innovative” and “failure matters”, Practical Strategies offers tips and hints to scholars looking to build or maintain their own digital humanities research agenda.

This talk will be held in the MITH Conference Room, in the basement of McKeldin Library.

Jennifer Guiliano is Assistant Director at MITH, leading development activities including grant writing and staff coordination, and a Center Affiliate of the [National Center for Supercomputing Applications](http://www.ncsa.illinois.edu/). Jennifer received a Masters of Arts in History from Miami University (2002), and a Masters of Arts (2004) in American History from the University of Illinois before completing her Ph.D. in History at the University of Illinois (2010). She has previously served as Associate Director of the [Center for Digital Humanities,](http://cdh.sc.edu/) at the [University of South Carolina](http://www.sc.edu/) where she was also a Research Assistant Professor of History. Jennifer is interested in image analytics associated with authorship related questions, and how computing transforms both the questions humanists can ask as well as the answers that can be generated with digital tools, methods, and pedagogies.

Coming up @MITH 10/25: Rachel Frick (Digital Library Federation Program, Council on Library and Information Resources), “Networked Macrosolutions: Library Peer-Sourced Collaborative Services"
