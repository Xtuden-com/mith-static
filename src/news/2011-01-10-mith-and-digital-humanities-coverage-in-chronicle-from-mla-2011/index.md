There is a great deal of coverage around the internet from the recent Modern Language Association convention regarding digital humanities. Here are links to two recent articles from the Chronicle of Higher Education that mention MITH:

["Pannapacker at MLA: Digital Humanities Triumphant?"](https://chronicle.com/blogs/brainstorm/pannapacker-at-mla-digital-humanities-triumphant/30915)

["Hard Times Sharpen the MLA's Lens on Labor and the Humanities"](http://chronicle.com/article/Hard-Times-Sharpen-the-MLAs/125905/)
