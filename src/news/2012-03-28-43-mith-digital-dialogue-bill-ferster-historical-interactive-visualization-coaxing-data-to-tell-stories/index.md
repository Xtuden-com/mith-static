![Bill Ferster](../../images/2012-04-billpic20101-200x200.jpg)Tuesday, April 3, 12:30-1:45pm 2117 Hornbake, South Wing (HCIL) Co-sponsored by the [Human Computer Interaction Lab](http://www.cs.umd.edu/hcil/)

"Historical Interactive Visualization: Coaxing Data to Tell Stories" by BILL FERSTER This talk will take an informal look at interactive visualization projects done at the University of Virginia's [Virginia Center for Digital History (VCDH)](http://www.vcdh.virginia.edu/index.php?page=VCDH) and the [Sciences, Arts, & Humanities Network of Technology Initiatives (SHANTI)](http://shanti.virginia.edu/) digital humanities centers. The projects were built using an NEH-funded visualization authoring tool, [VisualEyes](http://www.viseyes.org/), developed at UVa.

[VisualEyes](http://www.viseyes.org/) enables scholars to present selected primary source materials and research findings while encouraging active inquiry and hands-on learning among general and targeted audiences. It communicates through the use of dynamic displays that organize and present meaningful information in both traditional and multimedia formats, such as audio-video, animation, charts, maps, data, and interactive timelines.

I will also show a number of student-generated visualizations, created in the context of undergraduate project-based learning (PBL) seminars, and discuss how visualization and PBL are strong partners to promote historical inquiry. As a consequence, I have developed a new model to help scaffold the design of data-driven interactive projects called ASSERT. _Ask_ a question; _Search_ for evidence to answer that question; _Structure_ the data; _Envision_ ways to answer the question using the structured data; _Represent_ that data in a compelling interactive manner; and finally, _Tell_ a story using that data to answer the question.

This talk will take place in the Human Computer Interaction Lab, 2117 Hornbake Library (South).

**Bill Ferster** directs the [VisualEyes Project](http://www.viseyes.org/) at the University of Virginia with a joint faculty appointment with the Center for Technology and Teacher Education at the Curry School of Education, and with the Sciences, Humanities & Arts Technology Initiative (SHANTI) at the College of Arts and Sciences.

In past lives, he founded StageTools, a leading developer of digital motion control tools with its MovingPicture product; Editing Machines, EMMY award winning developer of the first digital nonlinear editing system; and West End, a pioneer in PC-based animation and presentation graphics tools.

A continuously updated schedule of talks is also available on the Digital Dialogues webpage.
