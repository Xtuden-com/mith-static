"You Can Take It With You: The Nascent Role for Mobile in the Digital Humanities"

by Kevin Bertram

More than four out of five American adults own at least one wireless device, and there are now more mobile phones in the United States than televisions and computers, combined. Despite the ubiquity of the cell phone, we are still only in the infancy of adoption of mobile's more advanced capabilities in the United States, and full-fledged explorations of its use within the humanities. This session will feature discussion of the current mobile landscape and possible visions for the mobile-enabled future, with a focus on innovative uses of mobile technology in the arts, and the technology's influence on language, literature and culture.

Kevin Bertram is founder and CEO of Distributive Networks, a Washington D.C.-based company that develops mobile content and technology services.

Coming up @MITH Oct. 3rd: Timothy Stinson (Johns Hopkins University), "Everything Old Is New Again: The Re-emergence of Medieval Polyvocality in Digital Manuscript Archives." View the complete Fall 2006 schedule for Digital Dialogues here:
