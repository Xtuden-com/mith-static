A MITH Digital Dialogue

Tuesday, April 4, 12:30-1:45

MITH Conference Room, McKeldin Library B0135

MITH is pleased to offer two of its current or recent faculty Fellows the opportunity to discuss their ongoing work in digital humanities. Please join us for these two presentations.

Early Americas Digital Archive

RALPH BAUER, Associate Professor of English

The Early Americas Digital Archive (EADA) is a collection of electronic texts and links to texts originally written in or about the Americas from 1492 to approximately 1820. It is open to the public for research and teaching purposes. It is intended as a long-term and inter-disciplinary project in progress committed to exploring the intersections between traditional humanities research and digital technologies and invites scholars from all disciplines to submit their editions of early American texts for publication.

Occupied Japan, 1945-1952: Gender, Class, Race

MARLENE MAYO, Associate Professor of History

The site contains thirty-two themes, biographies of eighteen leading and lesser known women, numerous images, and a wide range of texts ranging from fiction and poetry to oral histories and official documents. The site is intended for use not only in Japanese and East Asian History courses but also for American History, American Studies, Women's Studies, and Comparative Government and Politics.

Coming up @MITH, April 11: Patti Cossard (Subject Librarian, University Library): "The Multilingual Thesaurus for Medieval Studies"; Michele Mason (Doctoral Candidate, Communication, MITH Winnemore Dissertation Fellow): "Creating Digital Versions of Early 20th Century African-American Texts: Nannie Burroughs' 1928 'What the Negro Wants Politically.'"
