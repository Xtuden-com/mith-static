MITH and the Electronic Literature Organization are pleased to announce a public symposium on the [Future of Electronic Literature](http://mith.umd.edu/research/future-of-electronic-literature-symposium/), May 2 and 3 at the University of Maryland, College Park, with co-sponsorship from the University Libraries and Department of English. The keynote speakers will be **Kate Hayles** (John Charles Hillis Professor of Literature at UCLA) and **Kenneth Thibodeau** (Director of Electronic Records Archives Program, National Archives and Records Administration). In addition to the keynotes and associated panels, we are planning an electronic literature slam on the evening of May 2. A number of ELO Board members and other writers and artists will be in attendance; watch the Web site linked above for more details soon, but in the meantime save the date!
