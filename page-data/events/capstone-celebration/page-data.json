In the spring, MITH will continue collaborating on the best of these proposalsâ€”to help create the first version of the digital project. We'll be hearing presentations from across every division of the Libraries. So, no matter which project is selected, this capstone event will be a great demonstration of the creativity and scholarship of Maryland librarians and staff.\n**Please, come join us and support your colleagues!**\nCookies and light refreshments will be served.\n","start":"December 17, 2012","end":null,"location":"MITH Conference Room"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2857345991","3649515864","63159454"]}
