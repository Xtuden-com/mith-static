A MITH Digital Dialogue

Tuesday, December 2, 12:30-1:45

MITH Conference Room, McKeldin Library B0135

"Renaissance Moving Pictures: From Sidney's Funeral materials to Collaborative, Multimedia Nachleben."

by ELIZABETH BEARDEN, STEPHANIE CLARKE-GRAHAM, ELIZABETH MARTIN, and MICHAEL QUILLIGAN

Come hear us talk about the creation and significance of our multimedia website dedicated to the funeral procession of Sir Philip Sidney, which took place in London, England in 1587. With a panoply of visual, poetic, and musical records, the funeral survives as one of the most thoroughly documented Elizabethan public events, and the distribution of the funeral ephemera to the public made it possible for Sidney's contemporaries to recreate simulacra of the funeral in their own parlors. We will discuss why and how we have â€˜re-done' this famous courtier-poet's obsequies, hopefully giving inspiration and insight to those of you who would like to direct similar projects. Extensive collaborative work, interdisciplinary and interinstitutional cooperation, and contributions from both grad and undergrad students have enabled us to create a project with both scholarly and pedagogical value on a low budget and with gusto.

Project Director: ELIZABETH B. BEARDEN, Assistant Professor, English.

Bearden is working on a book entitled "Emblematics of the Self: Ekphrasis and Identity in Renaissance Imitations of Greek romance," has published work in PMLA, and has a forthcoming article in JEMCS. Having received her Ph. D. in Comparative Literature at NYU, she was hired at Maryland in 2006. Her research and teaching interests include early modern poetry and prose, the reception of antiquity in the Renaissance, word-image studies, Anglo-Spanish relations, transnationalism in romance, and the ways in which genre systems can reveal links between aesthetics and ethics in the early modern period.

Music Coordinator: STEPHANIE CLARKE-GRAHAM Ph.D. Candidate, English

Clarke-Graham is in her third year of the doctoral program in the Dept. of English. She intends to explore Early Modern English representations of the spaces of the Middle East and North Africa in her dissertation.
