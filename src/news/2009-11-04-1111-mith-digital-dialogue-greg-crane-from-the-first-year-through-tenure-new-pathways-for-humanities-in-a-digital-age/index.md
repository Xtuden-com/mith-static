A MITH Digital Dialogue

Wednesday, November 11, 3:30-4:45

MITH Conference Room, McKeldin Library B0135

"From the First Year Through Tenure: New Pathways for Humanities in a Digital Age" by GREG CRANE

Classical studies offers one particular, but potentially powerful, window onto possibilities for the humanities. A growing, international body of classicists are dedicated not simply to creating digital tools but to reimagining the field against the opportunities and challenges of the digital world in which we already live. On the one hand, we are beginning to see new possibilities for research that were not feasible with the tools of print culture. At the same time, and perhaps even more importantly, we are seeing a reorganization of who can participate and what they can contribute. We can see the possibility of a truly global field emerging, with implications far beyond the traditional bounds of

classical studies.

GREG CRANE is currently a Professor of Classics, as well as Editor-in-Chief of the Perseus Project at Tufts University. He has written two books on Thucydides; The Blinded Eye & The Ancient Simplicity, and is currently conducting preliminary research for a planned book on Cicero. He is particularly interested in the extent to which broadcast media such as the World Wide Web not only enhance the work of professional researchers and students in formal degree programs but create new audiences outside academia for cultural materials. His current research focuses on "computational humanities" and how this new field can help to democratize information without compromising intellectual rigor.

Coming up @ MITH 11/17: Jennifer Fleeger (Catholic), "Archiving America: The Vitaphone, the DVD, and Warner Bros. (re)store Jazz History"
