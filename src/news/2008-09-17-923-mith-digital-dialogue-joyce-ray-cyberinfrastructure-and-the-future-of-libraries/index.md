A MITH Digital Dialogue

Tuesday, September 23, 12:30-1:45

MITH Conference Room, McKeldin Library B0135

"Cyberinfrastructure and the Future of Libraries"

by JOYCE RAY, IMLS

What can libraries (and digital libraries) contribute to the infrastructure of the web, and how do libraries need to change to do this?

JOYCE RAY has directed the agency's discretionary library programs since 1997. An archivist by training, Joyce also has responsibility for agency-wide digital initiatives. Prior to joining IMLS, she held positions as Assistant Program Director for Technological Evaluation and Acting Program Director, National Historical Publications and Records Commission; Special Assistant to the Archivist, National Archives and Records Administration; and Head of Special Collections, the University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio.

She currently serves as a member of the program committee of the Joint Conference on Digital Libraries, is the U.S. organizer of the International Digital Cultural Content Forum, and is the principal organizer of the annual IMLS Web-Wise Conference on Libraries and Museums in the Digital World.

She helped to organize and was one of the first members of the Joint Committee on Libraries, Archives and Museums sponsored jointly by the American Library Association, the American Association of Museums, and the Society of American Archivists.

She is a certified archivist and holds a Master of Library Science from the University of Texas at Austin. In addition, she holds a PhD in American history, with a specialty in the social history of women and medicine in the U.S., and has taught women's history at Georgetown University. She has presented at numerous professional meetings about IMLS and its programs, and about trends in libraries, archives and museums relating to technology, professional education, and convergence.

Coming up @MITH 9/30: Tom Scheinfeldt and Dave Lester (George Mason University), "Omeka: Easy Web Publishing for Scholarship and Cultural Heritage"
