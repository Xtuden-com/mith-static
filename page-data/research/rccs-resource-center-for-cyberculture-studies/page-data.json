Collaborative in nature, RCCS sought to support ongoing conversations about the emerging field, to foster a community of students, teachers, scholars, explorers, and builders of cyberculture, and to showcase various models, works-in-progress, and on-line projects. As of 2002, the site contained a collection of scholarly resources, including university-level courses in cyberculture, events and conferences, an extensive annotated bibliography, and two full-length book reviews each month. RCCS was originally founded by David Silver in 1996 at UMD, and became part of a MITH Networked Associate Fellowship awarded to Silver in 2000-2001. \n","year_start":2000,"month_start":9,"year_end":2001,"month_end":6,"project_directors":"David Silver","participants":"Ben Shneiderman, Brenda Danet, David Gauntlett, David Silver, Douglas Rushkoff, Douglas Thomas, \"Earl Jackson, Jr\", Fay Sudweeks, Howard Rheingold, Jeff Tycz, Katie King, Mary Corbin Sies, Randy Bass, Robert Kolker, Shelley Pasnik, Steve Jones, Wendy Robinson","active":"FALSE"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2857345991","3649515864","63159454"]}
