MITH is pleased to announce Kyle Bickoff, doctoral candidate in the department of English at the University of Maryland, as the Winnemore Dissertation Fellow for 2019. During the fellowship, Bickoff will work on a chapter of his dissertation titled “A History of Digital Containers: Early 20th Century Memory Storage Technologies and the Origins of Containerization in Information Systems.” Bickoff’s work sits at the intersection of critical information studies, the history of technology, and media studies.

During the Winnemore Fellowship, Bickoff will trace the history of containers in computing, beginning with a material history of early computing storage technologies and turning to current developments in digital container systems in use at memory institutions such as libraries and archives. Bickoff’s work tackles questions of the developments in storage technology and the concept of acceleration of storage media. You can read more about Bickoff on his MITH Staff Page.
