Building on the previous sessions, we will demonstrate how temporal, network, sentiment, and geographic analyses on a subset of the Ferguson Twitter can aid understanding and enhance storytelling of a controversial event. These demonstrations will include hands-on exercises on categorizing tweets by location (from inside/outside Ferguson, MO) and sentiment (positive or negative language), visualizing the different groups of people taking part in the discussion, and detecting compelling moments in the data. This workshop will also introduce participants to tools and environments for performing such analysis independently and on other Twitter data sets, so participants should come prepared with a laptop. Workshop participants will gain skills in:\n- Network Analysis\n- Sentiment Analysis\n- Event Detection\n- Data Storytelling\n- Includes hands on demonstration of tools\n- Data Visualization with NodeXL\n\n","start":"April 9, 2015","end":null,"location":null}},"staticQueryHashes":["2857345991","3649515864","63159454"]}
