MITH is pleased to announce that we are officially accepting applications for the 2016-17 Winnemore Digital Humanities Dissertation Fellows Program. Every other academic year, MITH provides support to a graduate student whose dissertation engages the intersections between new media and the traditional concerns of the Arts and Humanities, offering a stipend equivalent to a semester-long Graduate Assistantship, including tuition and remission. The successful applicant also receives server space, consultations on the dissertation work, and technical support when needed.
