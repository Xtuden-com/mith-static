“Computational Historiography in a Century of Classics Journals” by DAVID MIMNO

What do you do with a book? Until recently, this has not been a difficult question, but the creation of massive databases of digitized documents has begun to enable researchers to explore new possibilities. Text can be seen not just as words to be read but as data to be measured. In this dialog, Mimno will present some examples of the use of computational methods to analyze 100 years of journal articles from JStor. Mimno will then consider how to extend this case study to general practice. How can we empower scholars to formulate hypotheses and test them experimentally, all while maintaining appropriate caution and skepticism?

The talk will be held in the MITH Seminar Room, in the basement of McKeldin Library.

[David Mimno](http://www.cs.umass.edu/~mimno/) is a postdoctoral researcher in the Computer Science department at Princeton University. His research is on data mining in text collections, with a focus on computational approaches to the Humanities. As a graduate student at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst he wrote the topic modeling package in the [MALLET machine learning toolkit](http://mallet.cs.umass.edu/). Prior to graduate school, he was Head Programmer at the [Perseus Project](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/) at Tufts University, where he designed and implemented the current Perseus web interface (Hopper 4.0). David's work is supported by a Digital Humanities Research grant from Google and a Computing Innovation fellowship from the National Science Foundation (NSF).

Coming up @MITH 10/04: Robert K. Nelson (Digital Scholarship Lab, University of Richmond), "Hardtack and Software: Topic Modeling Civil War Newspapers"
