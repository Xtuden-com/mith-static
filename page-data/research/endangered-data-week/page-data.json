The goals of Endangered Data Week are to promote care for endangered collections by publicizing the availability of datasets; increasing critical engagement with them, including through visualization and analysis; and by encouraging political activism for open data policies and the fostering of data skills through workshops on curation, documentation and discovery, improved access, and preservation. \n","year_start":2017,"month_start":4,"year_end":null,"month_end":null,"project_directors":"Purdom Lindblad","participants":"Adam Kriesberg, Amy Wickner, David Durden, Joseph Koivisto, Purdom Lindblad, Trevor Mu√±oz, Joshua Westgard","active":"FALSE"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2857345991","3649515864","63159454"]}
