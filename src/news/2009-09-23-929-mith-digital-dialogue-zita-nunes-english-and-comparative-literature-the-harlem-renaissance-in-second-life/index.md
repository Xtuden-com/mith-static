MITH Conference Room, McKeldin Library B0135

"The Harlem Rennaisance in Second Life"

By Zita Nunes

This talk will address various aspects of teaching in Second Life. Drawing on their two-year experience co-teaching courses on the Harlem Renaissance that have brought together students from the University of Maryland, the University of Central Missouri, and the Sorbonne, Bryan Carter and Zita Nunes will discuss the pedagogical opportunities afforded "in-world."

Bryan Carter is an Associate Professor of literature at the University of Central Missouri. He specializes in African American literature of the 20th Century with a primary focus on the Harlem Renaissance and has a secondary emphasis on visual culture. He has published numerous articles on his project, Virtual Harlem, an educational sim in Second Life representing Harlem as it existed during the Harlem Renaissance of the 1920s, and has presented it at locations around the world.

Zita Nunes is Associate Professor of English and Director of the Comparative Literature Program at the University of Maryland. She is the author of Cannibal Democracy: Race and Representation in the Literature and an organizer of the Digital Humanities and African American/African Diaspora Studies Conference.

Coming up @ MITH 10/6: Brad Pasanek (Virginia), "A Dictionary, a Database, and a Desultory Reader: Metaphors for the Mind in Eighteenth-Century Literature."
