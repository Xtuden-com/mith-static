"Ghosts of a Chance: A Museum-Based Alternate Reality Game" by GEORGINA GOODLANDER

The Smithsonian American Art Museum implemented the world's first museum-based Alternate Reality game titled "Ghosts of a Chance" in 2008. The game ran for three months, both on-line and in the real world, and attracted over 6,000 players. Goodlander will present an overview of the game, from a tattooed bodybuilder to the display of fake artifacts, with a discussion of the successes and failures encountered along the way. The talk will also include a sneak peak at the museum's plans for a future ARG.

GEORGINA BATH GOODLANDER is the Interpretive Programs Manager of the Luce Foundation Center for American Art at the Smithsonian Institution. She is responsible for all operations of the Center, including developing and overseeing a regular schedule of public programs, updating interpretative information, maintaining audiovisual installations, coordinating the selection and installation of collection objects in cases in the Center, and supervising staff. In 2008, she managed the creation of Ghosts of a Chance and developed a module version of the game, which is available to the public on a regular basis.
