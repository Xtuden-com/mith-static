"Developing Digital Curation Policies in a Local Context"

by KATE MURRAY (University Libraries)

As the sheer volume and complexity of digital objects expands, content creators and data managers have come to see the need for governing policies that encompass more than just archiving and preservation issues. The concept of "digital curation" encompasses both archiving and preservation but stresses a holistic lifecycle management approach to creating, selecting and maintaining digital objects and metadata. Several research projects have determined that curation awareness is strongest in the data-intense hard sciences such as physics and engineering but is gaining foothold in the humanities disciplines and information repositories. This presentation will explore the broad principles of digital curation and examine its implementation through institutional case studies of libraries and archives. Finally, the presentation will open up some questions about the challenges of developing and implementing local digital curation policies.

Since July 2006, KATE MURRAY is the Audiovisual Archivist at University of Maryland College Park Libraries and the chair of the libraries Digital Curation Policy subgroup. She has been involved with creating and maintaining digital dynamic media collections since 2001, serving first as the Digital Project Coordinator at University of Cape Town, South Africa, and later as the Audio and Visual Media Conservator at Emory University. She is the acting Secretary Treasurer of the American Institute for Conservation's Electronic Materials Group. Kate received her MLS from University of Cape Town in 2002.
