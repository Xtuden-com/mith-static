Interactive information visualization is a rapidly growing discipline that provides powerful new tools for digital humanities researchers. While many scholars quite reasonably resist data mining tools that present sometimes mysterious black-box results that are difficult to fathom, the new generation of interactive information visualization tools enables just the kind of open-ended exploration at which humanities researchers excel.

Whether simply comparing the 200-year usage frequency of certain words in the [Google N-gram Viewer](https://books.google.com/ngrams) or following relationship networks for 30,000 British individuals in [Kindred Britain](http://kindred.stanford.edu/), simple, clear visual presentations can produce valuable insights or simply appealing anecdotes to add to other analyses. Well-designed user interfaces and trustworthy databases are essential, but after that users can pursue specific research questions or playfully explore until something catches their attention. The most accessible of these tools require only a 30-second demonstration and are used in an Internet browser, but more advanced tools require program installation and hours of training.

University of Maryland researchers can already claim successes, such as [Tanya Clement’s dissertation work on Gertrude Stein’s _The Making of Americans_](http://llc.oxfordjournals.org/content/23/3/361.short) and her use of [advanced tools](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1321473). A related project probed the [erotics in Emily Dickinson's correspondence Clement](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1141781), now at the University of Texas, won their Best InfoVis prize in Digital Humanities for [her work on ProseVis](http://tclement.ischool.utexas.edu/ProseVis/) to visualize the\*\* \*\*sound including parts-of-speech, accent, phoneme, stress, tone, and break index.

I had the pleasure of helping with some of these projects as Computer Science students developed tools for word frequency analysis across multiple documents in [BasketLens](http://www.cs.umd.edu/hcil/textvis/basketlens/) and applied sophisticated statistical methods in [FeatureLens](http://www.cs.umd.edu/hcil/textvis/featurelens/).

My students have worked on digital humanities topics recently, like [this social network in Greek Mythology](https://wiki.cs.umd.edu/cmsc734_f13/images/b/be/Miyyerhw2.pdf). Diane Cline, a classicist at GWU, used our open source [NodeXL](http://www.codeplex.com/nodexl) to study Alexander the Great’s social network of 650 people. She did a great job (with only a little help from me), and is working towards a book on social network analysis for historians.

Nearby, UVA is a also a strong leader for digital humanities tools with Bill Ferster’s [VisualEyes](/Users/Stephan/Dropbox/MITH%20-%20Project%20Management/MITH%20Communications/Related%20DH%20Projects-Blog%20Posts/VisualEyes) and [SHIVA](http://shiva.virginia.edu/). I wrote the foreword for his [recent book on _Interactive Visualization_](http://mitpress.mit.edu/books/interactive-visualization-0).

Digital humanities researchers and students will have an unusual opportunity to learn about recent developments in visualization across disciplines in the Spring 2014 Lecture Series arranged by the Division of Information Technology with the Campus Visualization Partnership. The [eight lectures](http://viz.umd.edu/), by nationally prominent figures, begin on February 4 and go till April 22. Registration is required because lunch will be served and space is limited. Campus presentations on existing projects include [Audra Buck-Coleman](http://www.art.umd.edu/faculty/abuck/) (Fine Arts) and [Quint Gregory](http://arthistory.umd.edu/staff/Quint%20Gregory) (Michelle Smith Collaboratory for Visual Culture) The goal is to make University of Maryland a national role model for spreading visualization across the curriculum for research and teaching.
