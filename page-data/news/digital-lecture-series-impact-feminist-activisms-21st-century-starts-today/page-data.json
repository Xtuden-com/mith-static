This exciting series of lectures starts today.</p>\n<p>From the abstract for the series:</p>\n<p>\"Feminisms in the Digital Age: Transnational Activism in Germany and Beyond\" is a digital lecture series that explores the political impact of feminist activisms in the 21st century. In five lectures and a concluding roundtable, we interrogate the digital interface of transnational protest movements and local activism in feminist politics. The lectures take contemporary German protest culture as a case study for the manner in which transnational feminist activism intersects with the national configuration of feminist political work. We explore how movements and actions from outside Germanyâ€™s borders circulate digitally and resonate differently in new local contexts, and further, how these border-crossings transform grass-roots activism as it goes digital.</p>\n<p><img src=\"../images/2014-11-Feminisms-in-the-Digital-Age-Transnational-Activism-in-Germany-and-Beyond.png\" alt=\"Feminisms in the Digital Age - Transnational Activism in Germany and Beyond\"></p>\n<p>Lectures will be posted weekly on Mondays beginning today, November 3, 2014.
