MLTMS enables scholars to search a variety of electronic resources in different languages at a conceptual level whilst being based on both common and technical word-forms in the major languages used by scholars and other interested parties. Cross-language retrieval of search-results is therefore possible from a number of query-languages. MLTMS is an open source reference tool available to producers of reference works in medieval studies, both large and small.\n","year_start":2005,"month_start":1,"year_end":2005,"month_end":6,"project_directors":"Patricia Cossard","participants":"Patricia Cossard","active":"FALSE"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2857345991","3649515864","63159454"]}
