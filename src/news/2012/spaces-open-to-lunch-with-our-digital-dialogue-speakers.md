As part of our [Digital Dialogue](http://mith.umd.edu/digital-dialogues) series, we're offering a small number of spaces for graduate students, staff, and junior faculty to join our speakers for lunch. This is a great opportunity to engage directly with the speakers and discuss their work in a less formal setting. Space is limited, so please fill out the form at the following link with your preferences: <http://goo.gl/F76ss>.

Any questions can be sent to Amanda Visconti (visconti@umd.edu).
