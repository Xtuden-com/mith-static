"How to Play XML: Markup Technologies as Nomic Game"

by WENDELL PIEZ

What is a "game"? A definition is famously difficult. Wittgenstein, for example, after having described language as a game in his Philosophical Investigations, goes on to problematize the question of what a game is, using the word ("Spiel" in German) as a vivid example of the contingency and provisional nature of the supposedly clear concepts communicated by language. Game Theory, a branch of mathematics, solves this question by avoiding it, providing its own definition of "game," which only partially fits many or most games as we know them. And talking about games becomes really interesting when we reflect, as is inescapable since Peter Suber coined the term "nomic game" in 1982, that part of the action of many games, and indeed the essence of some, is in the process, play or competition of providing the game itself with its rules and hence its definition. Originally developed in reference to legislative systems as an illustration of "a game of self-amendment," Suber's rule set for the game "Nomic" quickly took on a life of its own and spawned a thought industry related to economics, sociology and anthropology, life sciences, psychology and politics.

Markup technologies such as HTML, XML and everything that go with them, from schemas to processing languages to public specifications and standards, have many game-like aspects. As in many games, much of the activity of markup technologies is devoted to rules enforcement; it also, in nomic fashion, extends to breaking received rules and making new ones. An engagement with markup technologies, or with any media production or software application design that relies on them, demands tactics and strategy, presenting us with problems and tradeoffs enmeshed in complexities both on and off the board, and challenging us to decide not only how we play, but what game we wish to be playing. Not only that, but the deeper we go, the more nomic it gets. As we ponder what we are doing with markup technologies and how they are changing what else we do -- as scholars, teachers, publishers and creative producers -- it is well if we reflect on who is making the rules, how, for whose benefit, and whether, to what extent and how we might aspire to be doing this ourselves.

WENDELL PIEZ was educated at the American School in Japan, Yale College (BA Classics, 1984) and Rutgers University (PhD English, 1991). Since 1994 he has worked with markup technologies, beginning with TEI and EAD SGML at the Center for Electronic Text in the Humanities at Rutgers and Princeton, and continuing with many varieties of document- and publishing-oriented XML since 1997. Since 1998 he has worked as a consultant at Mulberry Technologies, Inc., a leading developer of XML-based publishing solutions known for its work with (among many others) the Library of Congress and NLM/NCBI, the publishers of the Pubmed Central repository at the National Institutes of Health. He has taught numerous courses on XML, XSLT and related technologies to audiences in the public, private and academic sectors, and presented papers at industry and academic conferences on both practical and theoretical topics related to markup languages and their application. A member of the Association for Computers and the Humanities, since 2007 he has served as General Editor of Digital Humanities Quarterly.
