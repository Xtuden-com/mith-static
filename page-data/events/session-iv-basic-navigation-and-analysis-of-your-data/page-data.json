This workshop will help you do that by describing the anatomy of a Tweet, the mechanics of JSON data, and how to write a simple program to process the data. Learning how to dig into your Twitter dataset is an important step as you plan for some of the more advanced tools we will learn about in Session V. Participants in this workshop will come away with a better understanding of processing Twitter JSON data, and be able to programmatically explore the data with simple open source tools. This is a hands-on workshop, so in order to participate fully, please bring a personal laptop with you. You should also try to download and install Python and JQ (both are available free, see links below). We also recommend installing a text editor such as [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/).\nPython: <https://www.python.org/downloads/>\nJQ: <https://stedolan.github.io/jq/>\n","start":"March 26, 2015","end":null,"location":"Library Media Services, 0302J Hornbake Library North"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2857345991","3649515864","63159454"]}
