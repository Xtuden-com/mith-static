The centerpiece of the site is a considered metadata and modeling approach to computing hardware, whereby individual components of the vintage machines are documented, contextualized within their relation to the system as a whole, and expressed using Dublin Core. The site gathers links to other recent MITH projects in born-digital cultural heritage, and serves as a clearing house for our expanding portfolio in this area. It also includes newly written non-specialist's documentation for the FC5025 Floppy Disk Controller, a device used to retrieve data off of obsolescent media formats.\n","year_start":2008,"month_start":1,"year_end":null,"month_end":null,"project_directors":"Matthew Kirschenbaum","participants":"Charles Pinnix, Dave Lester, Elisabeth Kvernen, Matthew Kirschenbaum, Walker Sampson","active":"TRUE"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2857345991","3649515864","63159454"]}
