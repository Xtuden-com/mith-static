"The International Amateur Scanning League, Unlocking the Federal Archives One Work at a Time" by THOMAS GIDEON

The federal government has produced and continues to produce a staggering amount of material, most of which is released directly into the public domain. The policies and processes for providing broad access in the age of the internet are still catching up both to that volume and new technologies. Experiments in public-private partnerships have been tried with varying degrees of success. Even the most successful are burdened with odd limitations and restrictions. A small group of volunteers working directly with the National Archives are trying to change that.

THOMAS GIDEON ([@cmdln](http://www.twitter.com/cmdln)) is an advocate for free software and free culture. He blogs and podcasts about those experiments in digital commons along with technology policy in general, hacktivism, the experience of being an inveterate technology enthusiast and professional, and much more at _The Command Line_.
