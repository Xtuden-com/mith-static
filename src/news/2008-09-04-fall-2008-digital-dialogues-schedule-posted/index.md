MITH is pleased to announce another great semester of digital humanities talks at the University of Maryland: our [fall 2008 Digital Dialogues schedule is now online](http://web.archive.org/web/20100608224835/http://www.mith2.umd.edu/programs/mith_speakers_fall_2008.pdf). We look forward to seeing you this coming Tuesday, when Doug Reside presents on his recent work with AXE, the Ajax XML Encoder.

As always, all talks are free and open to the public.
