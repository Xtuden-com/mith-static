**To: All current and former members of MITH**

**From: Neil Fraistat, Director**

MITH Acting Associate Director Carl Stahmer has returned for family reasons to the San Diego area, where he will once again be able to surf the ocean daily, rather than just the Net. Although we will greatly miss Carl's presence day to day, he will remain a key part of MITH's staff. I'm happy to say that Carl has accepted a position with MITH as a Research Associate, through which MITH's fellows and grant projects will still be able to take advantage of his extraordinary talents as a conceptualizer of projects and a programmer. We hope to see him periodically throughout the year.
