MITH is very pleased to welcome Amanda Visconti as an intern working on MITH's Deena Larsen Collection. A graduate student at the University of Michigan's School of Information, she specializes in human-computer interaction. She holds an undergraduate degree in English; her interests combine web design, programming, and literature. She recently spent a term beginning an online digital text of James Joyce's Ulysses.

Amanda's internship is sponsored by the IMLS-funded Model Internship program, directed by Dr. Kari Kraus in Maryland's iSchool. She'll be with us through the DH09 conference in June.
