![Jeffrey Schnapp](/images/2012-04-jeffrey11-200x200.jpg)Tuesday, April 17, 12:30-1:45pm 6137 McKeldin Library, Special Events Co-sponsored by the School of Languages, Literatures, and Cultures

**"Building the Digital Public Library of America" by JEFFREY SCHNAPP**

I will be speaking about extraMUROS/Zeega, metaLAB's effort to allow anyone to easily explore, visualize and curate collections from public APIs and then use this media to collaboratively create multimedia projects that are accessible online, on mobile devices and in physical spaces. While books (in material and digital form alike) are vital to the future of libraries, I believe that in an increasingly audiovisual world of public knowledge and discourse, it is essential that libraries play a major role in preserving, making available and providing innovative tools for interpreting society's audiovisual past, present and future across media.

This talk will be held in the Special Events Room of McKeldin Library.

Before moving to Harvard in 2011, **Jeffrey T. Schnapp** occupied the Pierotti Chair of Italian Studies at Stanford, where he founded the Stanford Humanities Lab in 2000.

A cultural historian with research interests extending from antiquity to the present, his most recent books are Speed Limits and The Electric Information Age Book (a collaboration with the designer Adam Michaels of [Project Projects](http://projectprojects.com/) (Princeton Architectural Press, January 2012). Also forthcoming in 2012 are [Digital_Humanities (MIT Press)](http://jeffreyschnapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Untitled-2.png), a book co-written with Anne Burdick, Johanna Drucker, Peter Lunenfeld, and Todd Presner; Modernitalia (Peter Lang), a collection of essays on 20th century Italian cultural history being edited by Francesca Santovetti, and Italiamerica (Il Saggiatore), vol. 2, co-edited with Emanuela Scarpellini.

His pioneering work in the domains of digital humanities and digitally augmented approaches to cultural programming includes curatorial collaborations with the Triennale di Milano, the Cantor Center for the Visual Arts, the Wolfsonian-FIU, and the Canadian Center for Architecture. His [Trento Tunnels](https://web.archive.org/web/20161003024939/http://legallerie.tn.it/) project — a 6000 sq. meter pair of highway tunnels in Northern Italy repurposed as a history museum– was featured in the Italian pavilion of the 2010 Venice Biennale and is currently on exhibit at the MAXXI in Rome in RE-CYCLE. Strategie per la casa la città e il pianeta (fall 2011).

Faculty co-director of the Berkman Center for Internet and Society, he is Professor of Romance Languages & Literature and also on the teaching faculty in the Department of Architecture at Harvard's Graduate School of Design.

Dr. Schnapp is the faculty director of [metaLAB](http://metalab.harvard.edu/) at Harvard.
