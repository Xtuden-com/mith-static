A MITH Digital Dialogue

Tuesday, October 7, 12:30-1:45

MITH Conference Room, McKeldin Library

"EDUCE: Enhanced Digital Unwrapping for Conservation and Exploration."

by BRENT SEALES

Often, any attempt to read fragile texts, such as papyrus rolls, fundamentally and irreversibly alters the structure of the object in which they are contained. The EDUCE project is developing a non-destructive volumetric scanning framework to enable access to such objects without the need to physically open them. This work is based on earlier achievements in digital restoration that have recently been applied to the Venetus A in order to digitally flatten its pages. In this presentation I will discuss the overarching theme of digital restoration and will present current progress on the EDUCE project and results from work on the Venetus A.

W. BRENT SEALES received the BS degree in computer science from the University of Southwestern

Louisiana and the MS and PhD degrees in computer science from the University of Wisconsin-Madison. In 1991, he joined the Computer Science Faculty of the University of Kentucky and is now Gill Professor of Computer Science and Director of the Center for Visualization and Virtual Environments. His central research interest is in computer vision and image processing, with applications in digital libraries, medical visualization, and multimedia.
