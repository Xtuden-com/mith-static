Please join us in welcoming our new summer intern Xiaoyu Tai! Xiaoyu will be working with us for six weeks on a project related to the design and development of a newspaper viewing application powered by the IIIF standard.

Xiaoyu is a first year graduate student studying Human-Computer Interaction at the University of Maryland, and is also working at the University of Maryland Libraries as front-end developer. He enjoys user experience design and coding. [Click here](http://mith.umd.edu/people/person/xiaoyu-tai/) to access Xiaoyuâ€™s staff page and contact information.
