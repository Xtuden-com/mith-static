The conference will engage a range of issues involving the materiality of texts, including their physical, virtual, and performative manifestations as objects that can decay or break down and can potentially be repaired and sustained over time. It also concerns the processes of inclusion and exclusion through which bodies of texts take shape in the form of editions, archives, collections, and exhibition building, as well as the ethical responsibilities faced by textual scholars, archivists, conservationists, media archaeologists, digital resource creators, and cultural heritage professionals engaging in these processes.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://mith.umd.edu/sts2017\">Click here to view the conference website</a>, which now includes the program schedule and list of speakers (subject to change), a link to register, and information on hotel reservations and other logistics. <strong>Please note that there are a limited number of rooms available at the discounted group conference rate at the College Park Marriott, and room reservations must be made before April 17, 2017.</strong></p>\n<p>We are beyond excited to host this fantastic event, and hope to see many of your faces here in College Park in late May!!</p>"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2857345991","3649515864","63159454"]}
