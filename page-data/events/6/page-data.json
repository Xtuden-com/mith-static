To celebrate everyone's great work, MITH will be hosting a capstone event and party on **Monday, December 17, from 1:00-3:00 pm **(Hornbake 0301).\nLibrarians and staff who have participated in the Incubator process will present very brief \"project pitches\" describing their ideas for digital projects. In the spring, MITH will continue collaborating on the best of these proposals—to help create the first version of the digital project. We'll be hearing presentations from across every division of the Libraries. So, no matter which project is selected, this capstone event will be a great demonstration of the creativity and scholarship of Maryland librarians and staff.\n**Please, come join us and support your colleagues!**\nCookies and light refreshments will be served.\n","start":"December 17, 2012 00:12:00","end":null,"location":"MITH Conference Room"}},{"data":{"id":"hayim-lapin-a-digital-edition-of-a-classical-hebrew-text-the-digital-mishnah-project","title":"Hayim Lapin Digital Dialogue","type":["Digital Dialogue"],"description":null,"start":"December 4, 2012 00:12:00","end":null,"location":"MITH Conference Room"}},{"data":{"id":"workshop-4-project-development-principles","title":"Workshop #4: Project Development Principles","type":["Workshop"],"description":"_\\*\\*NOTE\\*\\* This workshop was repeated on December 3, 2012_\n","start":"November 28, 2012 00:11:00","end":null,"location":"MITH Conference Room"}},{"data":{"id":"sheila-brennan-getting-to-the-stuff-digital-cultural-heritage-collections-absence-and-memory","title":"Sheila Brennan Digital Dialogue","type":["Digital Dialogue"],"description":null,"start":"November 27, 2012 00:11:00","end":null,"location":"MITH Conference Room"}},{"data":{"id":"lisa-rhody-revising-ekphrasis-telling-the-sister-arts-story-through-topic-modeling-and-network-analysis","title":"Lisa Rhody Digital Dialogue","type":["Digital Dialogue"],"description":null,"start":"November 13, 2012 00:11:00","end":null,"location":"MITH Conference Room"}},{"data":{"id":"workshop-3-preparing--working-with-data","title":"Workshop #3: Preparing & Working with Data","type":["Workshop"],"description":"_\\*\\*NOTE\\*\\* This workshop was repeated on November 15, 2012_\n## Plan for the workshop:\n- Data on the Web\n- Hunting and Gathering (data dumps, screen scraping & web crawling, APIs)\n- Searching & Sorting (operating system tools, programming languages)\n- Structured Data\n- Example/Case Study (data for topic modeling)\n","start":"November 12, 2012 00:11:00","end":null,"location":"MITH Conference Room"}}],"pageInfo":{"pageCount":13}}},"pageContext":{"limit":25,"skip":125,"numPages":13,"currentPage":6}},"staticQueryHashes":["2857345991","3649515864","63159454"]}
