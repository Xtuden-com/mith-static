A MITH Digital Dialogue

Tuesday, February 12, 12:30-1:45

MITH Conference Room, McKeldin Library B0135

The Gamer Symphony Orchestra

with CHRIS APPLE, GREG COX, and JARRED YOUNG

MITH is very pleased to welcome UMD's Gamer Symphony Orchestra for music and conversation as we place the digital in dialogue with horns, strings, and voice. The GSO plays classical arrangements of music and scores from popular video games; no tinny Pac-Man Fever jingles here, rather music that brings to life the richness and breadth of the complex auditory soundscapes surrounding contemporary games like Halo, World of Warcraft, and Final Fantasy.

The GSO is composed of students from UMD as well as the surrounding community. Join us for a discussion and samples of their unique performances with music director CHRIS APPLE, conductor and arranger GREG COX, and president JARRED YOUNG.

For more information, including photos and recordings of their music, visit the GSO at http://umd.gamersymphony.org/.

Coming up @MITH: 2/19, there is no talk. 2/26, Doug Eyman (George Mason), "Play and Pedagogy: An Ecological Framework for Teaching Writing with Video Games."
