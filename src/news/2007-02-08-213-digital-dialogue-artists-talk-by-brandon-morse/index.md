A MITH Digital Dialogue

Tuesday, February 13, 12:30-1:45

MITH Conference Room, McKeldin Library B0135

Artist's Talk

[BRANDON MORSE](http://www.coplanar.org/)

"Though my work relies on digital technology as a staple component of its making, its content does not seek to tie itself to modernist explorations of traits bestowed on this recent addition to artistic practice. The conceptual focus of my work is instead the development and portrayal of situations of a specifically vague nature. To this end, I create computer generated sequences of video and audio which situate themselves somewhere between a specific narrative, and a non-event. These video components are then integrated into sculptural or installation settings to exist as multi-channel video objects."

Brandon Morse will demonstrate and discuss his digital/video art. He is Associate Professor of Art at the University of Maryland.

Coming up @MITH: This semester MITH will be sharing several of its Digital Dialogues slots with events sponsored by the Human Computer Interaction Lab (HCIL) Seminar Series. The first of these is Jeff Pierce, (IBM Almaden), "From Personal Computers to Personal Information Devices," Feb. 20th, 12:30, 2120 A.V. Williams Bldg.
