More than half of attendees were graduate students, early career scholars, or humanities adjuncts representing over a dozen different humanities disciplines and sub-disciplines.

These questions are especially vital when social media data is being used to study social justice issues.\nIn this workshop we’ll review basic research ethics for public datasets, and then discuss unsolved ethical challenges for the use of Twitter data. We will also discuss strategies for ensuring best-effort ethical approaches in this emerging research space. We’ll also consider Twitter datasets as materials for current and future archives—how is this medium redefining archival sources and notions of historical evidence? If we think of this data as part of a historical record does that change our evaluation of how the collection of data we have reflects actual public sentiments (its representativeness), and what biases might it reflect or contain in its construction. Who/what is being remembered, and who/what is being forgotten, when we study and preserve such data? And, finally, in order to facilitate active research now and maintain this data into the future we’ll cover basic strategies for managing and maintaining social media data collected as part of research.\n","start":"April 29, 2015 00:04:00","end":null,"location":"Library Media Services, Hornbake Library"}},{"data":{"id":"workshop-4","title":"Workshop 4","type":["Workshop","Training Institute"],"description":"## **AF Emory Agenda (revised February 19)**\nLocation: Jones Room, Woodruff Library\n## **DAY 1**\n8:30 – 9:00 am\n- Registration and Coffee\n9:00 – 9:15 am\n- Welcome\n### **Session 1: Led by Dr. Tina Herzberg**\n9:15 – 9:45 am: Lecture\n- Philip M.

social media. Building on the previous sessions, we will demonstrate how temporal, network, sentiment, and geographic analyses on a subset of the Ferguson Twitter can aid understanding and enhance storytelling of a controversial event. These demonstrations will include hands-on exercises on categorizing tweets by location (from inside/outside Ferguson, MO) and sentiment (positive or negative language), visualizing the different groups of people taking part in the discussion, and detecting compelling moments in the data. This workshop will also introduce participants to tools and environments for performing such analysis independently and on other Twitter data sets, so participants should come prepared with a laptop.

This workshop will help you do that by describing the anatomy of a Tweet, the mechanics of JSON data, and how to write a simple program to process the data. Learning how to dig into your Twitter dataset is an important step as you plan for some of the more advanced tools we will learn about in Session V.

The majority of the time will be spent creating your own collections of data using one of four tools: [TAGS](https://mashe.hawksey.info/2013/02/twitter-archive-tagsv5/), [IFTTT](https://ifttt.com/recipes/254160-twitter-search-google-sheet), [Social Feed Manager](http://social-feed-manager.readthedocs.org/en/m5_002/) and [twarc](http://github.com/edsu/twarc).\nThis is a hands on workshop, so please bring a laptop and ideas about the Twitter data you would like to collect. Also, if you are interested in using twarc, please install it prior to attending the workshop (installation details will be provided).\n","start":"February 19, 2015 00:02:00","end":null,"location":"MITH Conference Room, Hornbake Library 0301"}},{"data":{"id":"session-i-previewing-mith’s-teach-ins-for-blacklivesmatter-at-umd","title":"Session I: Previewing MITH’s Teach Ins for #BlackLivesMatter at #UMD","type":["Other Event","Workshop"],"description":"This first session is a reconvening of our Ferguson constituency, comprising faculty and students who attended one of the two first sessions in October and December at MITH, or who expressed interest separately.
