The Center for History and New Media's Echo project ([http://echo.gmu.edu](http://echo.gmu.edu/)) invites scholars of the history of science, technology, and industry to our second workshop on the theory and practice of digital history. Participants will explore the ways that digital technologies can facilitate the research, teaching, writing and presentation of history; genres of online history; website infrastructure and design; document digitization; the process of identifying and building online history audiences; and issues of copyright and preservation. The workshop, which is co-sponsored by the American Historical Association and the National History Center, will be held at George Mason University's Arlington campus, conveniently located in metropolitan Washington, DC. Thanks to support from the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation, there will be no registration fee, and a limited number of fellowships are available to defray the costs of travel and lodging for graduate students and young scholars. As spaces are limited, please submit an application form by March 10, 2006 (available at [http://chnm.gmu.edu/tools/surveys/1358/](http://web.archive.org/web/20151224083508/http://chnm.gmu.edu/tools/surveys/1358/)).
