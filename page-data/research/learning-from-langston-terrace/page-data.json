Opened in 1937, Langston Terrace housed Black low-income, working class families; it was one of 51 racially segregated projects built by the Public Works Administration as part of the New Deal. In collaboration with Kelly Quinn from UMD's Department of American Studies, MITH staff assisted with the creation of a website, Learning from Langston Terrace, which sought to commemorate the history of the community by compiling and offering primary sources for visitors. The materials on the site were meant to augment user's experiences and memories of Langston and the scholarly literature. \n","year_start":2001,"month_start":1,"year_end":2001,"month_end":6,"project_directors":"Kelly Quinn","participants":"George Williams, Gisele Audrey-Mills, Jason Rhody, Kelly Quinn, Martha Nell Smith","active":"FALSE"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2857345991","3649515864","63159454"]}
