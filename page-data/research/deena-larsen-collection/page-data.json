Deena is an author and new media visionary who has been active in the creative electronic writing community nearly since its inception in the 1980s. In addition to being a writer and thinker, Deena has also been a collector and an amateur archivist (or, as we say of amateurs, a hoarder). Deena's collection at MITH furnishes us with invaluable source material which will further both our in-house research in digital curation and preservation, as well as function as a primary resource for researchers interested in early hypertext and electronic literature.\n","year_start":2007,"month_start":5,"year_end":null,"month_end":null,"project_directors":"Matthew Kirschenbaum","participants":"Amanda Visconti, Matthew Kirschenbaum","active":"TRUE"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2857345991","3649515864","63159454"]}
