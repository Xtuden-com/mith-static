A MITH Digital Dialogue Tuesday, October 27, 12:30-1:45 MITH Conference Room, McKeldin Library B0135

"The Open Source Professor: Teaching, Research, and Transparency" by MARK SAMPLE

What happens when the scholarship of teaching meets Web 2.0? Professor Sample argues the ideal result is the open source professor, a teacher and scholar who applies the tenets of the open source software community to his or her own professional life. This means sharing, conversation, collaboration, and reflection at every step in the teaching and research process, not just with the final product. Technology plays a key role in making open source professing possible, and Professor Sample will discuss the philosophical and practical implications of such a transparent approach to pedagogy and scholarship, as well as possible pitfalls for untenured faculty.

PROFESSOR MARK SAMPLE teaches and researches contemporary American literature and Digital Culture at George Mason University. His most recent publication, in Game Studies, explores the interplay between video games, the War on Terror, and the production of knowledge. Professor Sample can be found blogging at http://www.samplereality.com.

Coming up @ MITH 11/3: Ben Bederson, Nick Chen, & Matt Kirschenbaum, "The Great Ebook Throwdown"
