Welcome to MITH's new Web site! This is the fourth iteration of MITH's Web presence since the Institute was founded in 1999.

The centerpiece of the new design is a Wordpress blog engine, which will allow us to add news and updates on a continual basis. In addition to information pertaining to our Fellows and the local community here, we will also feature news and announcements from the wider world of the digital humanities. Make MITH a destination for your daily browsing!

Comments and feedback on the site are welcome.
