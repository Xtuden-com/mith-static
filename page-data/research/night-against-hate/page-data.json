At our Night Against Hate event we will collaboratively try to link the SLC list to social media accounts. This list can then be used by researchers here at UMD and elsewhere to examine the effect that these groups are having online. In addition, we hope to use this event to learn from each other about emerging tools and techniques of self care while working online.\n","year_start":2016,"month_start":10,"year_end":null,"month_end":null,"project_directors":"Neil Fraistat","participants":"Ed Summers, Neil Fraistat, Purdom Lindblad, Stephanie Sapienza","active":"FALSE"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2857345991","3649515864","63159454"]}
